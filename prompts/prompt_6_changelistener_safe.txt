Given this data model:

```

```

This is example code working with the data model:

```
```

Implement a change listener for the "Program Increment" entity. It will be registered on the title attribute. It should only do something when a new Program Increment is created.

The change listener should set the predecessor attribute to the program increment object that is closest to the given program increment.

The triggering is done outside of the implementation. Just implement the logic assuming the triggering happened, and you get the program increment object bound.
