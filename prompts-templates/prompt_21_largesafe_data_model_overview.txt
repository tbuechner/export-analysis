The following xml schema represents describes a xml format for specifying data models:

```
{{ load_file('package-thinned-out-schema.xsd') }}
```

The following xml document is an example of a data model specified in the format described by the schema:

```
{{ load_file('pkg_okr/generated/thinned-out-compressed.xml') }}
```

The following code represents a data model of an application:

```
{{ load_file('pkg_largesafe/generated/basic-structure-compressed.xml') }}
```

Give me an overview of the data model of the application. Which of the types are the main types representing the core of the application?
