The following code contains a representation of a data model of an application:

```
{{ load_file('ws_okr/generated/types-compressed.json') }}
```

The following code contains a representation of 3 layouts of a page:

```
{{ load_file('ws_okr/generated/widgets-rewritten-first-3-compressed.json') }}
```

Explain these layouts to me.
