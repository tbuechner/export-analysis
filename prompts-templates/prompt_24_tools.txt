The following xml schema represents describes a xml format for specifying data models:

```
{{ load_file('package-thinned-out-schema.xsd') }}
```

The following xml document is a data model specified in the format described by the schema:

```
{{ load_file('pkg_okr/generated/thinned-out-compressed.xml') }}
```

I want to use AI - more specifically an LLM and even more specifically the OpenAI API - to generate data models in the prescribed format. It should be possible to generate new data models from scratch. Another use case is to modify / extend existing data models based on user input.

The end result of the user interaction with AI should be a new xml document that conforms to the schema.

How to approach this problem?

Should I let the AI generate the xml document directly? Or should I make use of functions which return the conceptual data model and then convert it to xml?
