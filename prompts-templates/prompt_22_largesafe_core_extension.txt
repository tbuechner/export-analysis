The following xml schema represents describes a xml format for specifying data models:

```
{{ load_file('package-thinned-out-schema.xsd') }}
```

The following xml document is an example of a data model specified in the format described by the schema:

```
{{ load_file('pkg_okr/generated/thinned-out-compressed.xml') }}
```

The following code represents a data model of an application:

```
{{ load_file('pkg_largesafe_core/generated/basic-structure-compressed.xml') }}
```

What would be potential extensions of the data model to enable additional capabilities?
