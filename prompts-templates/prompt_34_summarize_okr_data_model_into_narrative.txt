The following code contains a representation of a data model of an application:

```
{{ load_file('ws_okr/generated/types-compressed.json') }}
```

It follows this schema:

```
{{ load_file('json-schema.json') }}
```

Give me a summary of the data model.
What are the capabilities of the application?
What are the main operations that can be performed with the application?
What are the use cases of the application?

The capabilites and use cases should be described in a way that is understandable to a non-technical person.

The capabilities and use cases should cover most of the data model.
